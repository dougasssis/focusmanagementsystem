Focus Management System

Project created to a jiu-jitsu academy in order to manage its students and afiliates.

This was my first project at att all as a programer.

The language used was Python with Django Framework.

As it was my first project I am aware the code is not great and could be way more organized.

This is was a real project and is working great for my client.

- Login/Logout
- Register Branch only by Superuser
